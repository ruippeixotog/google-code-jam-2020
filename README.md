# Google Code Jam 2020

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from [Google Code Jam 2020][1].

## Instructions

You can compile all problems by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command, replacing `<problem_id>` with the section and identifier of the problem you want to compile (see section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible identifiers):

    $ make <problem_id>

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to the next one, replacing `<problem_id>` with the identifier of the desired problem:

    $ ./<problem_id>

Every problem in this repository reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.

## Problems Solved

The following is the list of the problems solved. Each problem identifier is specified between round brackets. Problems marked with ✓ are done, while problems with ✗ are not complete or aren't efficient enough for all the limits specified in the problem.
